This program first takes in a command line argument or uses 100,000 as the default number. Then, it checks to see if all numbers between two and the number are either prime, composite, or perfect numbers. If a number, is prime, then a "P" is printed. If a number isn't prime, then it is composite, and a "C" along with its proper divisors are printed. If a perfect number is found, then the proper divisors of the number, along with an "E" is printed. The program finds the prime and composite numbers by using the Sieve of Erathosenes, given by Professor Darelle Long.
