This program is split into two parts. First, the encoder takes in a file and
encodes it using the concept of the huffman tree and queue. The decoder then
takes the encoded file and decopresses it back into a copy of the original file inputted for the encoder. The decoding process involves using the huffman tree, as well as using a stack. My partner, Siri Bandaru, was responsible for the 
encoding part of the program. Therefore, she did the encoding.c, histogram, and parts of the queue. I was responsible for the decoding part of the program, so Idid the decoding.c and stack. Siri decided to combine the queue code into the 
huffman.c file, so she wrote queue code of the huffman file, while I wrote most of the actual huffman.c methods from the original huffman.h file given to us.
