This program is for the major sorting method algorithms. It includes min sort, bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort. It includes a source and header file for each of these algorithms, as well as a make file and sorting.c file. The executable file produced is called sorting. The program allows the user to specify the type of algorithm used using specific characters when running the program (./sorting). It also allows the user to print the array, set the random seed, and set the size of the array. For each type of sort, the program prints out the number of elements in the array, moves made, and comparisons between elements.
