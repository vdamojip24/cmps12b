I am submitting the lrc.c source file and lrc executable file. 
The lrc program simulates the left right center game. The program takes in a 
seed for the psuedorandom number generator and the number of players in the
game. After simulating the dice rolls for each player, the results of the round for each player are printed. The game continues play until only one player has
money left, and the money in the pot goes to the winning player.
