This program works by incorporating hash tables, hash functions, bloom filters, and linked lists. Scanf is used so the user can type in word(s) that is then checked by the program. If the word is not on the badspeak list that is given to us already, then it is fine. If the word is on the badspeak list, but its only a slightly bad word, then a warning message is printed. If the word is a really bad word, then the user is given no warnings and the message tells him/her/ze that he is sent to joycamp. There are options when compiling the program such as, -s -h -f -m -b, that is supported to specify sizes, statistics, etc. I couldnâ€™t quite figure how to use flex, so I attempted to create word parser for multi-word inputs.
